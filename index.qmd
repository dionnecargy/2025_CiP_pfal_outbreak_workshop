# The Scenario

In early 2025, an unexpected cluster of approximately 200 *Plasmodium falciparum* malaria cases was reported in a district of Namibia, Africa that had previously achieved malaria-free status in 2019. This district is a popular tourism destination, attracting visitors from across the world, making imported infections a key concern for surveillance teams.

Although local transmission in Namibia had been largely interrupted, bordering countries particularly Angola continue to experience substantial malaria transmission, including recent surges in case numbers. Because of the region’s interconnected human movement and historical importation events, rapid genomic investigation was initiated to determine whether this new outbreak represented:

-   A resurgence of local parasite circulation,
-   Ongoing regional transmission from neighbouring endemic countries, or
-   An imported outbreak from outside Africa.

To investigate, all cases were genotyped using a global 180-SNP barcode, providing a compact yet highly informative set of markers for population structure, relatedness, and transmission inference.

## Question

#### Can you you identify where in the world the outbreak has originated?
