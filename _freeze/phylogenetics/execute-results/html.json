Phylogenetic Tree (Neighbor-Joining)\n\n::: callout-note\n### Exercises for Section 5. Phylogenetic Tree (Neighbor-Joining)\n\n-   What patterns do you observe in this section?\n-   Which samples or populations stand out?\n-   What does this tell you about the population structure?\n-   Why do we use phylogenetic trees plots?\n\nOther tasks: - Use ggplot2 (<https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/)> to change colours or change the shapes of the countries. - What happens if you change the data to sites?\n\nEnsure you generate trees for both SEA and ARF datasets!\n:::\n\n### Phylogenetic Tree (Neighbor-Joining)\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ntree <- nj(dist_mat_SEA)\n\ntree_plot_SEA <- ggtree(tree, layout = \"fan\") %<+% meta_ord +\n  geom_tippoint(aes(color = country), size = 2) +\n  scale_color_viridis_d() +\n  theme_tree2() +\n  labs(title = \"Neighbor-Joining Tree of P. falciparum Samples\")\n```\n:::\n\n\n\n::: {.callout-note collapse=\"true\"}\n## Click to see plot\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](phylogenetics_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-1-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n:::\n\n### **Tree Purpose**\n\n-   Reconstruct relationships between samples.\n\n-   Show how lineages evolved over time.\n\n-   Help identify transmission clusters, founder haplotypes, and ancestral relationships.\n\n### **What a Tree Shows**\n\n-   Reconstructs evolutionary relationships between samples.\n\n-   Branch lengths reflect genetic distance or divergence.\n\n-   Clades represent groups with shared ancestry.\n\n### **Why It’s Useful for This Workshop**\n\n-   Can identify a single outbreak clade in Namibia.\n\n-   Confirms where the outbreak samples descend from.\n\n-   Highlights differences between:\n\n    -   outbreak lineage\n\n    -   local African diversity\n\n    -   SEA background structure\n\n### **Strengths**\n\n-   High interpretability: evolutionary history shown as branching patterns.\n\n-   Excellent for identifying clonal expansions, outbreak clusters, and transmissions.\n\n-   Works even with small numbers of SNPs (e.g. barcodes).\n\n### **Weaknesses**\n\n-   Distance-based trees (e.g., NJ) do not model evolution explicitly.\n\n-   Low SNP counts can produce low-resolution or uncertain topologies.\n\n-   Recombination in malaria violates tree assumptions - networks or clustering methods may be more accurate.\n\n-   Trees can mislead if there is strong admixture or reticulation.\n\n# Quiz time\n\n::: callout-note\n**When would you use a pcoa plot and a tree in the following scenarios?**\n\n1.  Explore broad population structure\n2.  Identify outbreak clusters\n3.  Examine evolutionary relationships\n4.  Identify drug resistant mutations\n5.  Detect admixture or complex ancestry\n6.  First-pass QC / exploratory analysis\n:::\n\n::: {.callout-tip collapse=\"true\"}\n## Solution\n\n| Purpose | Best Method | Why |\n|------------------------|------------------------|------------------------|\n| Explore broad population structure | PCoA | Fast, intuitive, clustering-focused |\n| Identify outbreak clusters | PCoA and Trees | PCoA visualises clusters, tree shows lineage |\n| Examine evolutionary relationships | Tree | Reflects ancestral history |\n| Detect admixture or complex ancestry | PCoA (or DAPC) | Trees can be misleading with recombination |\n| First-pass QC / exploratory analysis | PCoA | Quick sanity check |\n| Identify drug resistant mutations | Neither | These plots will not help us in identifying new or emerging mutations. You can however, colours the plots based on this metadata information. |\n:::\n",
