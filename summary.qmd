# Key Take-Home Messages

The workshop will walk you through how we identify these patterns using:

-   population structure methods (PCoA / DAPC)

-   phylogenetic trees

-   haplotype networks

-   drug-resistance markers

-   connectedness maps

-   genetic diversity & differentiation (π, Fst)

### **Distinct population structure**

There is a clear separation between Southeast Asian and African parasite populations.

-   SEA clusters tightly and distinctly from the rest.

-   African populations show broader diversity and weaker structure overall.

### **Drug-resistant lineage detection**

The outbreak lineage is characterised by:

-   C580Y kelch13 mutation,

-   A full background of crt, mdr1, dhfr, and dhps mutations typically associated with artemisinin and partner-drug resistance.

These mutations were exclusive to the Cambodian founders and the Namibia outbreak samples, confirming a single imported resistant lineage rather than local evolution.

### **Geographic patterns**

Mapping revealed:

-   Strong spatial clustering of outbreak-associated samples within Namibia.

-   Overlap and admixture among other African sites, consistent with regional gene flow.

-   Complete absence of SEA-type DR mutations outside the outbreak cluster.

### **Connectedness between populations**

Connectedness maps showed:

-   High genetic similarity links between Cambodian founder sites and Namibian outbreak sites.

-   Regional linkage clusters within Africa (e.g., Angola ↔ Botswana).

-   Weak or no genetic connectivity between distant African countries and between Africa and SEA, except for the imported lineage.

### **Genetic diversity and differentiation**

-   Nucleotide diversity (π) differed by site, reflecting varying transmission intensity and genetic mixing.

-   Pairwise Fst supported strong differentiation between regions and between outbreak and non-outbreak samples.

# Workshop Results

As we completed the genomic analysis, a striking pattern emerged:

### **Namibian outbreak parasites clustered tightly with a subset of Cambodian isolates.**

At first glance, this raised a fundamental question:

**Is the outbreak Cambodia imported to Africa OR is it Africa imported into Cambodia?**

This is a common source of confusion when interpreting “imported case” narratives.

### **The DNA doesn’t lie and it provides a consistent explanation.**

Although the outbreak parasites group with a small Cambodian lineage, those specific Cambodian samples themselves carry a largely African genetic history. This pattern can occur when:

-   a parasite population originally from Africa circulates in travellers or migrant workers in Asia

-   acquires additional mutations (e.g., drug-resistance markers such as C580Y)

-   and is later re-imported back into Africa

Genomics therefore reveals a bidirectional history in this dataset:

-   Deep ancestry, African-like genetic background

-   Recent evolutionary events including Southeast Asian-like drug-resistant profile (e.g., kelch13 C580Y)

-   Most recent movement from Cambodia back into Namibia

This complex genetic signature cannot be inferred from epidemiology alone.

### **Conclusion of the mystery**

The Namibia cluster was seeded by a recent importation of a Cambodian resistant lineage, itself derived historically from African ancestry but now evolving in Southeast Asia.

This demonstrates exactly why genomic surveillance is critical:

-   Epidemiology tells us that importation occurred.

-   Genomics tells us where from and which direction the parasites moved.
