# Key Take-Home Messages

By the end of this workshop, you should be able to:

<div>

> 1.  **Identify the outbreak source**
>
>     -   Use genetic clustering and tree-based analyses to pinpoint the Cambodian donor lineage that seeded the Namibia outbreak.
>
> 2.  **Recognise major population structure**
>
>     -   Distinguish African from Southeast Asian parasite populations using multivariate analyses and phylogenetic trees.
>
> 3.  **Interpret drug-resistance patterns**
>
>     -   Observe how resistance mutations (e.g., kelch13 C580Y, CRT, MDR1, DHFR, DHPS) cluster within the import-linked lineage.
>
>     -   Understand how resistance profiles reinforce evidence of importation.
>
> 4.  **Analyse geographic patterns**
>
>     -   Map sampling locations and resistance markers to visualise spatial patterns of transmission, importation, and diversity.
>
> 5.  **Understand transmission connectedness**
>
>     -   Use connectedness maps to compare genetic similarity between sites and countries, identifying likely transmission links and importation pathways.
>
> 6.  **Quantify genetic diversity and relatedness**
>
>     -   Use:
>
>         -   Nucleotide diversity (π) to compare variation between sites
>
>         -   Fst to measure differentiation
>
>         -   DAPC (optional) to identify and visualise clusters
>
>     -   Integrate these metrics to understand population structure and outbreak dynamics

# Workshop Results

> ### **Identification of the outbreak source**
>
> The genetic analyses consistently demonstrated that the Namibian outbreak cluster is most closely related to a small group of Cambodian isolates.\
>
> Across PCoA, phylogenetic trees, haplotype networks, and connectedness maps, the same pattern emerged:\
>
> → 10 Cambodian founder isolates seeded the Namibia outbreak.

> ### 
> **Distinct population structure**
>
> There is a clear separation between Southeast Asian and African parasite populations.
>
> -   SEA clusters tightly and distinctly from the rest.
>
> -   African populations show broader diversity and weaker structure overall.

> ### **Drug-resistant lineage detection**
>
> The outbreak lineage is characterised by:
>
> -   C580Y kelch13 mutation,
>
> -   A full background of crt, mdr1, dhfr, and dhps mutations typically associated with artemisinin and partner-drug resistance.
>
> These mutations were exclusive to the Cambodian founders and the Namibia outbreak samples, confirming a single imported resistant lineage rather than local evolution.

> ### **Geographic patterns**
>
> Mapping revealed:
>
> -   Strong spatial clustering of outbreak-associated samples within Namibia.
>
> -   Overlap and admixture among other African sites, consistent with regional gene flow.
>
> -   Complete absence of SEA-type DR mutations outside the outbreak cluster.

> ### **Connectedness between populations**
>
> Connectedness maps showed:
>
> -   High genetic similarity links between Cambodian founder sites and Namibian outbreak sites.
>
> -   Regional linkage clusters within Africa (e.g., Angola ↔ Botswana).
>
> -   Weak or no genetic connectivity between distant African countries and between Africa and SEA, except for the imported lineage.

> ### **Genetic diversity and differentiation**
>
> -   Nucleotide diversity (π) differed by site, reflecting varying transmission intensity and genetic mixing.
>
> -   Pairwise Fst supported strong differentiation between regions and between outbreak and non-outbreak samples.

### **Overall interpretation**

All analyses converge on the same conclusion:

➡️ The Namibia outbreak was caused by the importation of a drug-resistant Cambodian lineage, which then expanded locally.\

➡️ The outbreak did not originate from neighbouring African malaria populations.\

➡️ The “signature” of imported resistant parasites is detectable across multiple scales: SNP genotypes, population structure, haplotypes, and spatial networks.
